# SVG Logo Generator

## Description

- My motivation for this project was to create a tool to easily generate any sort of logo.
- I built this project to further utilize knowledge of generating files using user prompts.
- This code is effective in creating a personalized logo for many different needs.
- Composing this task scheduler, I learned how to prompt node to generate an SVG file correlating with user input.
